            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: October 17, 2025</strong></p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to Halloween AI ("we," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your
                privacy and ensuring you have a safe and enjoyable experience while using our application.
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when
                you use Halloween AI.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>

            <p><strong>2.1 Photos and Images</strong></p>
            <p>
                When you use Halloween AI, you may upload photos from your device's camera roll or take
                new photos using your device's camera. These photos are processed by our AI system to
                generate Halloween-themed transformations.
            </p>

            <p><strong>2.2 Generated Images</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Halloween-themed images created by our AI are stored locally on your device. We do not
                upload these images to our servers or any third-party services.
            </p>

            <p><strong>2.3 Anonymous Usage Data</strong></p>
            <p>
                We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the app.
                This may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>App features you use</li>
                <li>Time spent in the app</li>
                <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
                <li>App crashes and performance data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify you personally.
            </p>

            <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>

            <p><strong>3.1 Image Processing</strong></p>
            <p>
                Your photos are processed through Google's Gemini AI service to generate Halloween-themed
                transformations. During processing, images are temporarily transmitted to Google's servers
                via a secure, encrypted connection. Once the transformation is complete, images are not
                retained by Google or our services.
            </p>

            <p><strong>3.2 Local Storage</strong></p>
            <p>
                All generated images are stored locally on your device in the app's secure storage directory.
                You have full control over these images and can delete them at any time through the app's
                history feature.
            </p>

            <p><strong>3.3 App Improvement</strong></p>
            <p>
                We use anonymous analytics data to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how users interact with our app</li>
                <li>Identify and fix bugs</li>
                <li>Improve app performance and user experience</li>
                <li>Develop new features based on user preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>

            <p><strong>4.1 Google Gemini AI</strong></p>
            <p>
                We use Google's Gemini AI service for image generation. When you create a Halloween
                transformation, your photo is temporarily sent to Google's servers for processing. Google's
                privacy policy and data handling practices apply to this service. You can review Google's
                privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
            </p>

            <p><strong>4.2 Firebase Services</strong></p>
            <p>
                We use Firebase (a Google service) for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous user authentication</li>
                <li>Anonymous analytics</li>
                <li>App security (Firebase App Check)</li>

            </p>

            <p><strong>4.3 No Sale of Personal Data</strong></p>
            <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information or photos to any third parties
                for marketing or any other purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Data Storage and Security</h3>

            <p><strong>5.1 Local Storage</strong></p>
            <p>
                All your photos and generated images are stored locally on your device. We employ
                industry-standard security measures to protect data stored in the app.
            </p>

            <p><strong>5.2 Data Transmission</strong></p>
            <p>
                When images are sent to Google's Gemini AI for processing, they are transmitted over
                secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
            </p>

            <p><strong>5.3 Data Retention</strong></p>
            <p>
                Your photos and generated images remain on your device until you manually delete them
                through the app's history feature or by uninstalling the app.
            </p>
